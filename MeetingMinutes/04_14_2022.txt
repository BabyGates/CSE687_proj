file management class - open file, read words, close file, return vector<string> words.
                        - create new file, write and append. don't remove punctuation
Moira

Map class - accept vector<string> words from file management class. populate the actual map(word, 1). map() constructor
            remove punctuation
            export() - write the map to the temp location using the file management class.
            
            map(words);
            map.export(); -> the, 1
                             and, 1
                             the, 1
                             write to the temp folder

Reduce -    sort(inputfile) - transform the, 1    into: the, 1, 1
                             and, 1                     and, 1
                             the, 1
            reduce(inputFile) - the, 1, 1      -> take summation. Save to file     the, 2   
                                and, 1                                              and, 1
                                
Executive: main.cpp - map(sourcefile); map.export; Reducer(); reducer.sort(map); reducer.export(tempfile);

gtest, spdlog for errors, or logger class.

What is the workflow component???
subwords, what defined a word? (just text separated by whitespace?)
punctuation?
