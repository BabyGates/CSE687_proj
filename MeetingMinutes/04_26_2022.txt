issues with github, have stuff saved to forked branches
Moira - filesystem class with bugs
shutong - mapper class started

Helpped diagnose and fix some bugs, finihsed writing classes, integrated with my working code. 
removed mapper member vector of words - this will cause headaches down the road with multithreading

file i/o bug where the stringstream buffer isn't being flushed causing duplicate information to be kept around between filesystem
thought this was a bug in the trie but determined to be the file manager class

meeting tomorrow to work unit tests
