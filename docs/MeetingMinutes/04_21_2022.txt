shutong - no updates, able to run program from last meeting
miora - issues with boost compiling. started file system class

-------------

// moira
// reading funcs
// reading input
file io will read all files in input folder and return vector<string> with each index being a unique file's whole string
// reading temp
read(string path, int key){
    open the file<key> file
    for each line in the file{
        push each line to a string vector
    }
    return the vector
}

// writing funcs
write line(directory, int key (aka filenumber), contentsAsString, ){
    create if doesn't exist. and append.
    write(outputDir, file + key (file0, file1, file2...))
    
}


--------
// workflow
// called in the workflow
run(tempdir){
    int counter = 0;
    for the size of the vector aka for every file in the directory {
        map(coutner (0, 1, 2.... increment as we loop), vector[index], temp dir)
        // when map finishes, we will have a temp dir with stuff
        // read the temp stuff
        vector<string> read(path, counter)
        sort(vector of intermediate data)
        
        if (reduce (the output of sort)){
            make SUCCESS file
        }
        else { make FAILURE file }
        
        // redurce calls export so we're done here. keep looping through the input files
        
        
        counter++
        // the counter is the key
    }
}


// shutong
map(int key, vector, temp dir){
    break into words
    remove punctuation
    vector<string> cleanworkds (no punctioation, no whitespace)
    export(vector, tempdir, int key)
}

export(vector, tempdir, int key){
    for each word in vector{
        // we need to use moira's function here
        write(tempdir, "word, 1 (contents as a string)", int key) 
    }
}

----------------------
//bool reduce
string builder class for the weird syntax

export(vector<string> input, key, path){
    write(path, key, string contents)

}

sort()


// unit test!!!!!
